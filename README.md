# Inventory

> Little helper application to manage cellar inventory.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Idea

The idea is to create a Nuxt.js application with a PHP backend.
At this point the app persists the data in a file (so they are at least persisted).
